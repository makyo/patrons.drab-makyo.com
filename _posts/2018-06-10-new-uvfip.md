title: New Unimportant Verse for Important People
---

More love poems I'll never send.

<div class="verse">
When a light so far above me shines down,
I lose my footing, stop, look around,
and for once, see my way lit before me.

Through you,
    I learn how I move.
Through you,
    I see how I act.
Through you,
    I judge myself.

When a light so far above me shines down,
I turn my face to the warmth and bask,
drawing strength, assured in my steps.

Through you,
    I recognize my failings.
Through you,
    I understand my strengths.
Through you,
    I gain perspective.

When a light so far above me shines down,
I reach toward it and grasp at what I can,
hoping I might somehow gain my own luster.

Through you,
    I find my place.
Through you,
    I gain surety.
Through you,
    I learn who I am.

When a light so far above me shines down,
and I fail to shine myself,
I hope only to reflect what I can.

<div class="verse">
Every time I seek to change
my life, myself, my love, my name,
every time I try and broaden my range
in this shitty, all-encompassing game,
I hesitate.

With every change in my life
comes the terror of maybe losing you
of maybe being caught in strife
over such insecurities as few
have escaped unscathed.

That you love me still
reaffirms so many of my choices,
and I set about with a will,
ignoring querulous voices
in favor of your calm laugh.
